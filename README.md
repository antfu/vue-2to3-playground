# Vue 2to3 Playground

A playground to test typing difference between [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) and [Vue 2 with Composition API](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api).

This is an workspace setup for VS Code.

To use it, you would need to clone the repos into the same directory

```
folder/
  vue-next/
  vue-composition-api/
  vue-2to3-playground/
```

and then you can open the `vue-2to3-playground/vue-2to3.code-workspace` workspace in VS Code.
